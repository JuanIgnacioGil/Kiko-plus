  I am waiting for my case to come up
  and I am waiting
  for a rebirth of wonder
  and I am waiting for someone
  to really discover America
  and wail
  and I am waiting
  for the discovery
  of a new symbolic western frontier
  and I am waiting
  for the American Eagle
  to really spread its wings
  and straighten up and fly right
  and I am waiting
  for the Age of Anxiety
  to drop dead
  and I am waiting
  for the war to be fought
  which will make the world safe
  for anarchy
  and I am waiting
  for the final withering away
  of all governments
  and I am perpetually awaiting
  a rebirth of wonder

  I am waiting for the Second Coming
  and I am waiting
  for a religious revival
  to sweep thru the state of Arizona
  and I am waiting
  for the Grapes of Wrath to be stored
  and I am waiting
  for them to prove
  that God is really American
  and I am waiting
  to see God on television
  piped onto church altars
  if only they can find
  the right channel
  to tune in on
  and I am waiting
  for the Last Supper to be served again
  with a strange new appetizer
  and I am perpetually awaiting
  a rebirth of wonder

  I am waiting for my number to be called
  and I am waiting
  for the Salvation Army to take over
  and I am waiting
  for the meek to be blessed
  and inherit the earth
  without taxes
  and I am waiting
  for forests and animals
  to reclaim the earth as theirs
  and I am waiting
  for a way to be devised
  to destroy all nationalisms
  without killing anybody
  and I am waiting
  for linnets and planets to fall like rain
  and I am waiting for lovers and weepers
  to lie down together again
  in a new rebirth of wonder

  I am waiting for the Great Divide to be crossed
  and I am anxiously waiting
  for the secret of eternal life to be discovered
  by an obscure general practitioner
  and I am waiting
  for the storms of life
  to be over
  and I am waiting
  to set sail for happiness
  and I am waiting
  for a reconstructed Mayflower
  to reach America
  with its picture story and tv rights
  sold in advance to the natives
  and I am waiting
  for the lost music to sound again
  in the Lost Continent
  in a new rebirth of wonder

  I am waiting for the day
  that maketh all things clear
  and I am awaiting retribution
  for what America did
  to Tom Sawyer
  and I am waiting
  for Alice in Wonderland
  to retransmit to me
  her total dream of innocence
  and I am waiting
  for Childe Roland to come
  to the final darkest tower
  and I am waiting
  for Aphrodite
  to grow live arms
  at a final disarmament conference
  in a new rebirth of wonder

  I am waiting
  to get some intimations
  of immortality
  by recollecting my early childhood
  and I am waiting
  for the green mornings to come again
  youth’s dumb green fields come back again
  and I am waiting
  for some strains of unpremeditated art
  to shake my typewriter
  and I am waiting to write
  the great indelible poem
  and I am waiting
  for the last long careless rapture
  and I am perpetually waiting
  for the fleeing lovers on the Grecian Urn
  to catch each other up at last
  and embrace
  and I am awaiting
  perpetually and forever
  a renaissance of wonder
